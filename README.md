# 🇺🇸 US Visa Appointment Automation Bot (Experimental Project)

This is an experimental automation bot built using **Playwright** to interact with the US visa appointment system.

> ⚠️ Disclaimer: This bot is currently **unsuccessful** and gets detected as a bot by the system. However, it served as a valuable **learning experience**, and I’m sharing it openly so others can learn from it or build upon it.

## 🎯 Purpose

- Experiment with real-world browser automation using Playwright
- Understand the structure of online visa appointment systems
- Learn about bot detection and browser fingerprinting

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Playwright
- Async flows and CLI interaction
- Random delays and behavior simulation

## 📌 Current Status

- The bot gets flagged by the system and is blocked
- Shared for educational and development purposes only
- Not designed to bypass advanced anti-bot mechanisms

## 👨‍💻 Who Might Find This Useful?

- Developers learning Playwright or browser automation
- People curious about how visa appointment systems work
- Contributors interested in building or experimenting with bots

## ⚖️ Legal / Ethical Notice
